avrecode: lossless re-compression of compressed video streams
=============================================================

avrecode reads an already-compressed video file and writes a more compressed
file. Unlike transcoding, which loses fidelity, the compression algorithm used
by avrecode is reversible. The decompressed bytes exactly match the original
input file. However, avrecode's compressed format can only be read by avrecode
-- an avrecode-compressed file cannot be played directly by standard software.

avrecode works by decoding the video stream into symbols using ffmpeg's
libavcodec. It tries to predict each symbol as it arrives, and re-encodes the
symbols to the compressed file using arithmetic coding. When avrecode's
predictions are higher quality than the predictions specified by the H.264
standard, it achieves a better compression ratio.


Installing
----------

avrecode consists of a compression/decompression program and a fork of the
libavcodec library, part of the ffmpeg project. These live in separate github
repositories:

- https://github.com/dropbox/avrecode
- https://github.com/dropbox/libavcodec-hooks

The avrecode repository imports the libavcodec-hooks repository as a submodule,
so the `git submodule` command is used to keep them in sync.

Download the source:

```
git clone https://github.com/dropbox/avrecode
cd avrecode
git submodule update --init
```

Build and test:

```
brew install protobuf
cd ffmpeg
./configure
make
cd ..
make
./recode roundtrip data/GOPR4542.MP4
```
